Developers Task Bounty

Centurion Program: Scrypta Developer Task Bounty


With the upcoming release of the official Scrypta developer documentation — our efforts will be focused on building the Scrypta developer community. Alongside the growth of our user-base, these next steps include building a brand new community for developers.

The developer community will become our focus point to unite developers, help them better participate and contribute in Scrypta’s development.

Following our core blockchain values — open-source and decentralization — we hopes more and more developers can participate and contribute in the Scrypta Ecosystem development.

Today Scrypta Foundation launching the Centurion Program: Scrypta Developer Task Bounty and inviting all developers to join. Any developer can participate, contribute and earn rewards for their efforts in contributing to the project. 

This is the first of two bounty programs: the launch of our Pretorian Program: Security & Bug Bounty will be released shortly. Together we will maximize the value and the potential of the Scrypta Ecosystem!

By joining Scrypta Server on Discord, or by following Scrypta’s official account on Medium, developers can see all the latest tasks.

The Bounty Program will be also available on a specific Github Repository, allowing developers to easily work on and claim the bounties.

What are the open tasks developers can participate in?

TASK_1: Improvements on Scrypta Manent App
Manent App is the mobile version of our light wallet, is built in Ionic and it needs some minor improvement before launch. All major bugs are written here: https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-manent-app/projects/1. 
There are small and big issues, however main functions are fully functioning.

Bounty Range: up to 15000 LYRA

TASK_2: ScryptaID Extension
There are some open tasks about the Firefox version and even here we need UX and UI improvements. We need a focus on the Identity management which needs to be built from scratch.

Bounty Range: up to 10000 LYRA

TASK_3: ScryptaID Backend
ScryptaID needs to be improved from scratch. The idea is to built a microservice with NodeJS and PassportJS with the single function of validate external accounts and creates hooks with a Lyra address. This service should be called directly from ScryptaID extension, opening a new webpage where user can validate (clientside) all the desired accounts. The Extension will inject those authenticated accounts in the dApp, so the user will be able to interact with some specific identities. Another kind of user validation should be done through 2FA with the same idea, the secret code will be written (encrypted) inside the Lyra address and the validation will be at Extension level.

Bounty Range: up to 10000 LYRA
