### Centurion Program: Scrypta Developer Task Bounty


With the upcoming release of the official Scrypta developer documentation — our efforts will be focused on building the Scrypta developer community. Alongside the growth of our user-base, these next steps include building a brand new community for developers.

The developer community will become our focus point to unite developers, help them better participate and contribute in Scrypta’s development.

Following our core blockchain values — open-source and decentralization — we hopes more and more developers can participate and contribute in the Scrypta Ecosystem development.

Today Scrypta Foundation launching the Centurion Program: Scrypta Developer Task Bounty and inviting all developers to join. Any developer can participate, contribute and earn rewards for their efforts in contributing to the project. 

This is the first of two bounty programs: the launch of our Pretorian Program: Security & Bug Bounty will be released shortly. Together we will maximize the value and the potential of the Scrypta Ecosystem!

By joining Scrypta Server on Discord, or by following Scrypta’s official account on Medium, developers can see all the latest tasks.

The Bounty Program will be also available on a specific Github Repository, allowing developers to easily work on and claim the bounties.

What are the open tasks developers can participate in?
